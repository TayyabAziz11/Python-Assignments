# 🧠 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Assignment in Python

This repository contains a comprehensive set of Python exercises designed to reinforce core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It is an excellent resource for beginners and intermediate learners who want to practice and understand OOP principles such as **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction**, and more.

## 📚 Assignment Overview

The assignment includes **21 problems**, each crafted to demonstrate a specific OOP concept. You will implement:

- Classes and objects  
- Instance, class, and static methods  
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected)  
- Inheritance and method resolution order  
- Decorators (function, class, and property)  
- Custom exceptions and iterators

Each concept is covered through a practical problem statement.
